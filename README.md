# Thinkmill Design System Style Guide

Important Note: This style guide is currently very WIP

---

This style guide documents the standards for building and maintaining design systems we follow at Thinkmill along with explaining the reasoning for our decisions and tooling.

This style guide is intended to be a living representation of how we work with design systems so over time, the recommendations will change as tools and workflows evolve. While the guide is designed holistically, the tools and decisions in this guide can be used independently of each other.

## Concepts

> What is a design system? Purpose, Goals, Reasoning.

# Design Tokens

## Global Tokens

## Packs

# Theming

# Components

Components encapsulate functionality that renders a `view` with `styles` based on a `state`.

`(state) => ({ styles, view })`

We also recognise functional building blocks and controllers that are used by components to manage state, side effects and other concerns.
