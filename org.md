## Ask questions and listen

- Find out about the progress of the design
- Find out about the progress of a component lib
- Find out if the design already follows a component lib like symbols in Sketch shared with designers
- Find out what the dominate tech stack is on the front end
- Find out about how designers and developers work together
  - What does the handover look like?
- Is there wire-framing, user-research, content guidelines
