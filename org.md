## Ask questions and listen

- Find out about the progress of the design
- Find out about the progress of a component lib
- Find out if the design already follows a component lib like symbols in Sketch shared with designers
- Find out what the dominate tech stack is on the front end
- Find out about how designers and developers work together
  - What does the handover look like?
- Is there wire-framing, user-research, content guidelines

## UI-inventory

- Get all components together
- Get all colors together
- Get all text styles together (ignore only color)
- Get all icons together (Iconography and other images)

## Tech-inventory

- Determine the stack(s)
- Find component libs (there are usually a bunch)
- Find out restrictions, eg access to GitHub, npm etc
- Talk to devs in projects and see how they work
- What js solution works best?
- What css solution works best?
