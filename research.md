#Research: Finding the problems the design system needs to solve

##Development

###Tech Stack

- How do we ask about the tech stack without biasing the answers?
	- Be careful of "preferred solution" over reality & limitations of the org.
	- Very important to understand what the team is most comfortable working with. Eg: The team _wants_ to use react, but actually get work done most efficiently with jquery. 
- What is the current testing approach?
- Ask about the stack. (Javascript/frameworks/processors/build steps)
- How is the project staged and released
- What is the deployment pipeline
- How are production bugs dealt with


###How the development collaborates

- How do developers share code
- Where? (npm? github?)
- Is there a code review / pr process?
- How is shared code versioned (semver?)


###Handover from Design

- What artifact is handed over from design
- How many gaps are in the design for the developer to fill
- Is handed over content considered final, or a working draft
- How does a developer have input in the design


###Limitations

- Are there any access limitations? (security, npm/github auth, permission to install tools)
- Are there any political limitations? (eg. office politics, or using competitors tools)


###Skill level

- How mature is the capability of the team?
- How distributed is the knowledge of the stack?

###Pain points

- What is difficult in the current process?
- What is hard about [tech stack, collaboration, handover, limitations, skill level?

##Design

###Tooling

- How do we ask about the design tooling without getting into holy wars? (adobe/sketch/figma) etc.

###How the team collaborates

- How do designers collaborate on files? (eg. Sketch/Abstract, Figma, Dropbox)
- Is a review/approval process to put design into production? Where does sign-off come from?
- Are design resources versioned in any way?
- Does the team make use of shared libraries external to working files?

###Pain points

- What is difficult in the current process?
- What is hard about scaling out individual designs to multiple products?

###Handover to Dev

- What fidelity is design usually handed over as? (eg. Full pixel perfect renders, wireframes etc)
- Is there a process for iterating on that design? Do iterations happen in design tooling after handover or straight to code?

###Limitations

- Are there stylistic limitations? (colours to avoid, use of iconography)
- Is there an existing style guide or pattern library? 

###Skill level

- How mature is the capability of the team?
- Do the designers on the team lean towards system-oriented design or layout/presentation oriented design
